# 💡 Interactive Neon Desk Lamp – CSS Animation

A small front-end project that recreates an interactive desk lamp using **pure HTML & CSS**.  
The lamp can be turned ON and OFF using a custom switch, and the animation simulates a neon-style light beam.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This mini-project focuses on:
- Creating shapes using only CSS (no images)
- Building an interactive switch using a `<input type="checkbox">`
- Simulating a light beam with CSS borders and transparency
- Adding neon glow effects with `drop-shadow()` and RGBA values
- Practicing clean layout using absolute positioning

The goal was to design a small but visually appealing component that demonstrates animation, interaction, and styling skills.
